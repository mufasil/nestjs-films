# Film Project

This repository contains a Node.js project built using the Nest.js framework. Follow the instructions below to clone the Git repository, install the project's dependencies using npm, and start the Nest.js application.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (npm is included with Node.js, so there's no need to install it separately)

## Clone the Repository

To get started, clone this Git repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mufasil/nestjs-films
```

## Install Project Dependencies

Navigate to the project's root directory using the terminal and run the following command to install the project's dependencies:

```bash
cd <project_directory>
npm install
```

Replace `<project_directory>` with the name of the directory where you cloned the repository.

## Install Nest CLI Globally

To run Nest.js applications and generate Nest.js components, it's recommended to install the Nest CLI globally. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
npm install -g @nestjs/cli
```

## Start the Nest.js Application

Once you have installed the project's dependencies and the Nest CLI, you can start the Nest.js application using the following command:

```bash
nest start
```

This command will start the Nest.js application, and it will be accessible at the default address `http://localhost:3000/`.

That's it! You've successfully cloned the Git repository, installed the project's dependencies, installed the Nest CLI globally, and started the Nest.js application. You can now begin developing your Nest.js application.
